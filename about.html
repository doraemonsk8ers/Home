<p>
Doraemon.Sk8ers is a new security research group in Singapore since 2012.
Doraemon.Sk8ers, founded since 2012, is a team made up of various members and contributors in Singapore's security community. <br />
Each member has a unique skill set that contributes to the team. <br />
Our team consists of open-minded and friendly people that enjoy chatting, laughing and working together.
</p>

<p>
Our members have played quite a number of Capture the Flag (CTF) games around the world (CodeGate, picoCTF, Defcon, plaidCTF) in the last 2 years under various CTF team names(Team Doraemon, doraemon.sk8ers, etc). <br />
We didn't win any of the competition but we learned a lot along the way by reading from other teams' writeups and tweets. 
We are still learning from all the other teams.<br />
In the beginning of 2013, we decided to stick with doraemon as our official CTF team name.
